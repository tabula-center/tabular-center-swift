// The macro package's checks.
//
// A plain executable with a hand-rolled assertion harness, not a test target,
// for the reason `tabular-center-swift/Package.swift` records: nixpkgs' Swift ships no
// XCTest, and a test framework that has to be resolved is a test framework
// that can stop the tests from running.
//
// ## Why this exists before the thing it tests
//
// `MachineMacro` is SwiftSyntax nodes to a `RawMachine` and nothing else
// (SURFACE.md). That is a function over syntax trees, so it can be exercised
// by parsing a source string with `SwiftParser` and inspecting what comes
// back — no macro expansion, no compiler plugin, no `CompilerPluginSupport`.
//
// Which turns SURFACE.md's two "answerable in an hour with a toolchain that
// can compile a macro" questions into questions a test answers here:
//
//   - whether `@Row` on a `static let` is even parseable as an attribute
//   - whether the nested enums can be read off the attached declaration's
//     members
//
// The first is settled below, and the answer is yes: `SwiftParser` produces an
// `AttributeSyntax` for it regardless of whether any macro is declared, because
// parsing does not resolve attributes. The traversal can therefore be written
// and tested before the `.macro` target is declarable.
